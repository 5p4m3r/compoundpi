  * A GUI client (cpigui) is now included. This is currently undocumented, but
    should be pretty intuitive to anyone familiar with the command line
    interface (#3)
  * Both clients and the server now support many more camera settings
    including white-balance, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, etc (#12)
  * All UDP messages (client and server) are now retried to ensure
    reliability, particularly during multiple unicast messages (#13)
